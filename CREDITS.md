## Used modules

### Simple Calendar

Weather Control heavily relies on [Simple Calendar](https://github.com/vigoren/foundryvtt-simple-calendar) by [Vigoren](https://github.com/vigoren). Without his incredible work handling date and time (which is known to be very hard to do in the programming world) and providing an API for it all, this module would be much harder to develop and maintain.

## Original Author

This module would not exist without the work of [DasSauerkraut](https://github.com/DasSauerkraut). Everything done in version 3.1.1 and earlier was made by him and other [contributors](https://github.com/DasSauerkraut/calendar-weather/graphs/contributors).
