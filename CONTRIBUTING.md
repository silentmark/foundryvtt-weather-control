## Code of Conduct

We take our open source community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://gitlab.com/jstebenne/foundryvtt-calendar-weather/-/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Merge Requests (MRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will instruct you to select the appropriate template and guide you to fill out the required informations.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/award_emojis.html) can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Commits

We ask that commits should be kept clean and to avoid commit messages that only make sense to you and that you follow good practices. Read this [blog post by Chris Beams](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) and you'll be good to go!

Here is a TLDR:

- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

### Pull Requests

MRs to the project are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, MRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Be accompanied by a complete Merge Request template (must be selected when creating the Merge Request).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a MR in our repository and follow the MR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

## Code Quality

This project is maintained by professionnals, but being one is not a requirement to contribute code, issues or feedback. However strict code quality guidelines are enforced to keep it easy to contribute code and maintain it.

We will keep our guidelines update to date with our best effort in the [project's wiki](https://gitlab.com/jstebenne/foundryvtt-calendar-weather/-/wikis/Code-Quality-Guidelines).

Writing good quality code isn't easy, but it should not block anyone from contributing. When we review your code, do not take it personnal. We are reviewing the code and not your ability to write it.
